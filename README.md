# Hotels
Hotels, a web application that helps users search for hotels based on location, budget, facilities offered, ratings and so on. 
The results can be sorted by price low to high or high to low.
The frontend was developed using Reactjs and designed using Material-UI with MySQL as a database to hold hotel details, and state management was performed using Redux.
